                <h1>About Over Population</h1>
                <p1>- In 1800, the population of the islands that make up the Philippines' territory was estimated to be around 1.89 million. Throughout the nineteenth century, the archipelago's population grew steadily, reaching nearly 6.5 million people by 1900.</p1>
                <p2>- Overpopulation is thought to be caused primarily by poverty. Impoverished areas experience large population booms due to a lack of educational resources combined with high death rates leading to higher birth rates.</p2>
                <p3>- Overpopulation occurs when a place's population grows to the point where there is insufficient space, food, water, or other resources to support it. It is one of the many issues that the world is dealing with today.</p3>
                <p4>- One of the most pressing issues confronting humanity today is overpopulation. The overpopulation of people on the planet has an impact on the health and well-being of our planet. Overpopulation affects us all because food scarcity will increase, pollution will increase, and global warming will worsen.</p4>

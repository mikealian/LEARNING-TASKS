        <ol>
        
        <li>Raw beef, roll it in the flour...fry 4‚Äê5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal...put to one side when all done.</li>
        <li>cut the onions into quarters...fry in the same frying pan as the beef...to soak up the juices...</li>
        <li>Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.</li>
        <li>Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour.</li>
        <li>pour on the bottle of beer really, it isn't going to be wasted!!!</li>
        <li>Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me...serve with mash.</li>
